Recently, following Barcelona's league game win over Espanyol, one [headline](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barca/20200708/barcelona-espanyol-resultado-8032259) read:  [^1]

>Barca send Espanyol to the Segunda with a minimal victory

Minimal victory. One zero. In most sports, the narrowest margin of victory is obvious and easily understood. In soccer it's a single penalty. In basketball a single point, overtime notwithstanding. And yet, a one zero victory in extra time, or overtime, means more to us, the audience.[^2]

Largely to the same degree, maximum margin of victory is totally unknown in most sports. To be changed by the next best team, battering the next worst. Discussions are had, about which 20 point victory or 5 goal triumph was more dominant amongst rivals, but it's just that, discussions. 

Wherever the scoring system is such that one point, or goal, or second can dictate the victor, added stakes must mean something else. To me, the topic of margin of victory is most compelling in the context of MMA.

I think I meant that in sports where a goal is enough to win, added stakes have to come from some other external factor.

  What is the minimum margin of victory in mixed martial arts? Surely it's a fight where a decision determines the outcome?

  No fan tunes in to watch the minimum margin of victory in mixed martial arts. This can be said without hyperbole.
