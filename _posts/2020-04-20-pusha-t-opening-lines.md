As a solo artist, Pusha T has spent the last nine years in music making a first impression. Following his critically acclaimed run as half of the now legendary duo Clipse, the New York-born, Virginia-raised MC continues to stand atop the rap industry as one of its most precise lyricists. Nowhere, however, does Pusha T make a better first impression than at the outset of his songs. 

Since the days of _Hell Hath No Fury_, Pusha T and his brother Malice[^1] were inimitable. Imitators could’ve rapped about drug dealing&mdash;and they tried&mdash;but they couldn’t make the paranoia and fear that came with it all feel palpable, unless they lived it. And anyone who listened knows&mdash;the Clipse did. 

If history is any indicator in music, the release of the next Pusha T album will decidedly open with a few lines used to set the record in motion. In the meantime, examples of Pusha T’s defining openers are spread across his[^2] discography, let’s take a look. 

**Pusha T — [King Push](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAFVu_A4OwQ) (My Name Is My Name, 2013)**

On King Push, the lead track of his debut solo album, _My Name Is My Name_, Pusha T opens succinctly, as only he can:

>   This is my time, this is my hour <br>
    This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power <br>
    If it's my reign, then it's my shower <br>
    This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours

It’s declarative, it’s instinctual, it’s liberating. There is no more time for first impressions, guest verses, or anything but his world of rap. The motorsport reference is good&mdash;and classic Pusha T—but it’s overshadowed by his admission. They have shared the same last name since birth, but Malice was now No Malice, Terrence Thornton remained Pusha T, but he carved his own path&mdash;and he’s making sure you know it. 

**Pusha T — [Changing of the Guards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhsyc12msSM) ft. Diddy (Fear of God II, 2011)**

On _Fear of God II_, an EP re-release of his earlier debut solo mixtape _Fear of God_, Pusha delivers from the jump:

>   It's like the changing of the guards <br>
    We changing out the frauds

The opening line is straightforward enough. There is a double entendre—this is still Pusha T—but that's not the point. The message is clear: he is a solo artist&mdash;[his peer’s prayers](https://genius.com/176344) have gone unanswered&mdash;and there’s nothing they can do about it. Perhaps more revelatory even, is his admission on the opener of the—ironically enough—last track of the album. On Alone In Vegas he confesses: 

**Pusha T — [Alone in Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o011Uuqe_Q4) (Fear of God II, 2011)**

>   I let you into my diary to admire me <br>
    The makeup of this man, I let you see the higher me

It’s the most boastful vulnerability anyone not named Kanye West can get away with in rap, without sounding trite&mdash;and its executed perfectly. Pusha T is willing to let you in on his insecurities, as long as you know he’s not doing this for you. 

Take the aptly named “Intro” of _King Push – Darkest Before Dawn_[^3] where he introduces us once again to the ever-present “drug dealer dichotomy” that has powered his career. Back again is Mr. Lee—Dominican accent unmistakable as ever—with:

**Pusha T — [Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCuTxAZZv3A) (Darkest Before Dawn, 2015)**

>   Espera, ven aquí, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? <br>
    You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mío. <br>
    You gotta pick one, daddy <br>

Pusha T answers Mr. Lee—and himself—with a warning of sorts:

>   Leave your conscience at the door <br>
    We done hid the monsters in the floor <br>

Once again Pusha invites us into his world, but this time there are no holds barred. All will be said. This is not a conscious rap album, it will be solely evocative. Simple because that’s the only way he will allow himself to tell the story. This is no longer “coke rap”. To call it that would be naive and insulting. This is a Mayweather right hand, a LeBron breakaway dunk, a Nadal forehand—it’s tone-setting, career-defining, yet notably different each time. 

On Runaway, Kanye’s _nine-minute_ masterpiece, Pusha T serves as a foil to Kanye’s cowardice. Kanye won’t walk away, instead, he asks you too. Pusha opens with a primer of what’s to come, “24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind” he growls. Before serving the perfect contrast to Kanye’s attitude throughout the song:

**Kanye West — [Runaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YpuRIgt6gc) ft. Pusha T (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 2010)**

>   I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it <br>
    Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it

The message is the same, but there’s a difference in delivery—a level of harshness. Before all the openers that would define his solo projects, Pusha T showed us how to deliver the essence of a song[^4] in a few lines or less.

Most surprising perhaps is that these opening lines stick out at all. Pusha T is, to his credit, so adept as a lyricist that we begin to look for more than double entendres from his songs. These lines are special, not because of their rhyme pattern, but because of their placement and significance. There is no word wasted, no bar overlooked. In a world of drug dealers turned storytellers, every last bit counts.

Pusha T doesn’t rap, he enunciates with purpose. For this, amongst his peers he stands out, pulled from a time where this was valued most. Every major rap artist has their trademark, for Kendrick it’s political protests on wax, for Kanye, his unprecedented auteur-esque approach to music making. 

No other rapper opens as emphatically and intelligently as Pusha. It may take 48 minutes of music for most artists to deliver the theme of their work, asking them to do this in several lines at the forefront of every album&mdash;or song&mdash;is cruel, and restrictive. Pusha T made this his signature, and for it he is unique.
