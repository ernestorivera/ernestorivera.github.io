Recently, following Barcelona's league game win over Espanyol, one [headline](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barca/20200708/barcelona-espanyol-resultado-8032259) read:[^1]

>Barca send Espanyol to the Segunda with a minimal victory

Minimal victory. One zero. In most sports, the narrowest margin of victory is obvious and easily understood. In soccer it's a single goal. In basketball a single point, you get it. Of course, a one - zero victory in extra time, or overtime, will always means more to the viewer.[^2]

Largely to the same degree, but in the opposite direction—maximum margin of victory is undefined in most sports. To be constantly changed by the next best team, battering the next worst. Discussions are had, about which 30 point victory or 5 goal rout was more dominant amongst rivals, but they’re just that, discussions. 

Answering the question of what’s the worst defeat one team has ever handed another is easy by scoreline, but difficult by any other metric. We can equate the number of goals or points won by as the only measure of dominance, but that’s lazy. A 3-0 victory can be more dominant than a 5-0 one, in context.

The lines blur further when we look at individual sports. Personally I think the topic of margin of victory is most compelling in the context of mixed martial arts.

The narrowest margin of victory in MMA is again, superficially obvious.[^3] The widest margin of victory possible however, is murky.

To illustrate a point, let’s imagine we have two fights between fighter A and fighter B, with fighter A winning both fights—the first via five second knockout, and the second on 50-43 across all three judges' scorecards.[^4] Which of these is a wider margin of victory?

On one hand you can argue that a five second knockout is as quickly as you can dispose of an opponent, and thus the widest margin of victory. On the other hand, you could say the first fight was a fortunate outcome, and that the second example is more dominant. As a five round rout proves fighter A is better than fighter B in more if not all areas.

See? It gets weird. 

Trying to argue between which fight was won by a wider margin, is a fun barbershop discussion that you won't ever agree upon. 

More interesting is the divide where minimal victory is preferred over maximal. In my eyes, most common sports are defined by this characteristic— you’d rather see a 101-100 basketball game than a 130-105 game, all else equal.[^5]

Using mixed martial arts as a vehicle to describe most modern combat sports—it’s fair to say that in MMA, unlike most other mainstream sports, maximal victory is the reason viewers tune in. Some dorks will argue that a close, technical, hard to judge battle is the reason they watch, but they can’t even take themselves seriously.

No one tunes in to watch the minimum margin of victory in MMA. This can be said without hyperbole.

[^1]: It reads better in spanish: El Barça envía al Espanyol a Segunda con un triunfo mínimo

[^2]: And likely the athlete. This is a whole topic worth discussion in a separate post. For now, I'll ignore it.

[^3]: Difficult to condense due to differing fight lengths (3 vs 5 rounds) and scoring system. Look it up if you’re unfamiliar with the 10 point must system—which is undeniably the worst.

[^4]: In the ten point must system, this would mean every judge scored all rounds for fighter A, with two rounds being 10-8 rounds and the other three being 10-9. This would be a rout by all definitions.

[^5]: We aren’t talking about that dorky team you love to watch win by 25 points.
